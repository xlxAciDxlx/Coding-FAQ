# Coding FAQ

Below are answers to some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in regards to code stuffs.

## How long have you been coding?

I've been coding for roughly 10-12 years, at least from about the time I started to learn to code.

## What language(s) should I start out with learning?

While not particularly helpful for making super cool stuff, `HTML` and `CSS` can be two things that are relatively easy to learn and can give you the basic fundamentals of coding.

## What language(s) did you start out with learning?

Half of the reason I recommend HTML and CSS, is because back in the days of MySpace (I know, I'm mega old :P) that was what I started out with learning to customize my MySpace profile. From there, I learned PHP, and so on and so fourth.

## What language(s) do you currently know?

- C# (_some_)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- TypeScript

## What Code Editor/IDE do you use?

For most things, my editor of choice is Visual Studio Code. However, if I'm working on a Minecraft Mod, I'm typically using _IntelliJ IDEA_. I eventually plan to try to try writing a mod using Visual Studio Code and it's Java extension to see how well converting my entire workflow to Visual Studio Code would work.

## What extensions do you use for Visual Studio Code?

<!-- TODO: Fill this out -->

Once I find a good way to export my whole Extension list, I will fill this out.

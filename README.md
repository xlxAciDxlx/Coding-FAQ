# Coding FAQ

Below are answers to some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in regards to code stuff.

## Want your question answered here?

If I forgot to answer something, feel free to drop me a DM on Discord with your question, and I'll update this to add the answer.

## How long have you been coding?

I've been coding for roughly 10-12 years, at least from about the time I started to learn to code.

## What language(s) should I start out with learning?

While not particularly helpful for making super cool stuff, `HTML` and `CSS` can be two things that are relatively easy to learn and can give you the basic fundamentals of coding.

## What language(s) did you start out with learning?

Half of the reason I recommend HTML and CSS is because back in the days of MySpace (I know, I'm mega old :P) that was what I started out with learning to customize my MySpace profile. From there, I learned PHP, and so on and so forth.

## What language(s) do you currently know?

- C#
- JavaScript
- PHP
- TypeScript

## What Code Editor/IDE do you use?

### General

For most things, my editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (referred to as _VS Code_ through the rest of this document).

### Minecraft

For making **_Minecraft Mods_**, I prefer to use [IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (referred to as _IDEA_ throughout the rest of this document) as it's feature rich and allows for minimal IDE setup to get in and coding. I eventually plan to try to try writing a mod using VS Code and it's Java extension to see how well converting my entire workflow to Visual Studio Code would work, but have yet to have the time or energy to attempt that.

## What extensions/icons/theme do you use for VS Code?

**_NOTE:_** This may be out of date, as the extensions I use frequently change depending on need/functionality desires.

### Icons/Theme

## What do you use for taking notes?

### Code Documentation

For **_TypeScript_** projects, I use [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/). I have yet to experiment (or really have a need to look into) other documentation generators.

### Planned/Future Features or Ideas
For general things, I would like to achieve in a project (for example new features, etc) I use the [TODO+ plugin for _VS Code_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus).

### Public Notes
I eventually plan to use Google Drive/Docs for public notes (like this one) that can be updated and viewed in real-time, though I'm not sure this is worth the effort as I don't have many notes I want/need to be public at this time..
